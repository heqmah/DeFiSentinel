# DeFi Sentinel Smart Contract

## Overview
DeFi Sentinel is an advanced DeFi analytics and staking contract built on the Stacks blockchain. This contract integrates multi-tier staking, governance voting, and emergency control features, allowing users to stake STX, earn rewards, participate in governance, and manage their collateral positions securely.

## Features
- **Staking System**: Users can stake STX tokens with flexible lock-in periods to earn rewards.
- **Tiered Rewards**: Different staking levels offer increased rewards and governance privileges.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Users can create and vote on proposals to shape the platform.
- **Emergency Controls**: The contract owner can pause or resume operations in case of emergencies.
- **Unstaking Mechanism**: Users can unstake with a cooldown period to ensure stability.

## Smart Contract Details
- **Fungible Token**: The contract issues an `ANALYTICS-TOKEN` as a reward for staking.
- **Governance Proposals**: Users with sufficient voting power can create and vote on proposals.
- **Emergency Mode**: The contract can be paused during unforeseen situations.
- **Data Maps**: Stores user positions, staking details, and governance data.
- **Reward Calculation**: Uses staking amounts, tiers, and multipliers to compute earnings.

## Contract Constants
- **Base Reward Rate**: 5% (u500, where 100 = 1%)
- **Bonus Rate**: 1% additional per extended staking period
- **Minimum Stake**: 1,000,000 uSTX
- **Cooldown Period**: 1,440 blocks (approx. 24 hours)

## Installation & Deployment
To deploy the contract, use the Clarity smart contract language and the Stacks CLI:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the contract folder.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DeFiSentinel.git
   cd DeFiSentinel
   ```
2. Deploy the contract using the Stacks CLI:
   ```sh
   clarinet test
   ```
3. If tests pass, deploy the contract:
   ```sh
   stacks deploy contract.clar
   ```

## Usage Guide
### Staking STX
To stake STX tokens, call the `stake-stx` function with the amount and lock period:
```clar
(stake-stx u1000000 u4320) ;; Stake 1M uSTX for 1 month
```

### Initiate Unstaking
To begin unstaking, use:
```clar
(initiate-unstake u500000) ;; Unstake 500k uSTX
```

### Governance Proposal
To create a new governance proposal:
```clar
(create-proposal "Increase staking rewards" u10000)
```

### Voting on Proposals
To vote in favor of a proposal:
```clar
(vote-on-proposal u1 true)
```

### Emergency Actions
To pause the contract (only owner):
```clar
(pause-contract)
```
To resume the contract:
```clar
(resume-contract)
```

## Security Measures
- Only the contract owner can activate emergency controls.
- The cooldown period prevents instant withdrawals, ensuring staking stability.
- Governance requires a minimum stake for proposal creation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated Yield Strategies**: Implement auto-compounding rewards.
- **Liquidity Pool Integration**: Enable swapping analytics tokens.
- **NFT-Based Staking Tiers**: Use NFTs to represent tier levels.
